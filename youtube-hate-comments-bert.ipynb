Of course, violence is not the answer, nevertheless, you should never provoke. Football has a problem, hooliganism! The fan is lucky that Viera did not do a 'Cantona' on him. There few fans trying to be a group of losers as well by shoving Viera from back and front! Losers! Kudos goes to a few fans that protected Viera and defuse the situation!   \n",

              "3   This Is The Good News From God\\n\\n we’ve all broke God’s morals laws thousands of times over we’ve all lied, hurt someone physically or emotionally and gossiped about another person and much more so.. we’re guilty before The judge who is  God.. God like a judge in court can’t let the guilty go unpunished but if someone pays your fine you can leave innocent that’s What God did He became a human and lived the sinless perfect life and then died for your and my sins our moral crimes against God. God took the punishment we owe and then 3 days Later He rose from The dead ( I encourage you to look at the evidence for The resurrection of Jesus Christ and evidence for God’s existence ) I was suicidal and felt like There wouldn’t be a real reason to not commit suicide Then I saw a youtube video pop up on my phone about Jesus and the gospel message and it said if I accept Jesus Chirst as my Lord and Savior from my sins and ask Him to Fill me With His Holy Spirit I would be saved and God would change my life from the inside out and I said a prayer for Jesus to come and change my life and I told Him “I will do whatever you want me to just take this anxiety from me!” and in a second I saw a Light It was The Holy Spirit He entered me and I could only describe the feeling like “ I feel alive for the first time in my life” and “I felt litterly what Truth feels like” and ever since I have seen God do miralces through me like healing people litterly instant healing or people’s body’s and also cast out demons I’m am 19 and God saved my life and If you accept Christ as your Lord and Savior Ask To be filled With His Holy Spirit and To forgive your sins by believing He rose from The dead you will go to heaven and God will put heaven into you That’s what The bible says you can do this now God loves you Enough to become human and die for you.   \n",

Bright colours and flashing lights to be easily seen by anyone they're searching for, and how light is us and how it can walk and fly to go across different terrain, that'd be pretty decent for exploration.\\n\\nOr heck, maybe it will just be used for recreational use, or educational.

I just thought it is funny. lol.  Don't go and freak out, I know its not a mask, lol. It's all in fun.   \n",

(Pardon my french) Jeff is simply in this for his on empowerment, immortality and control! These ideas are very dangerous and will be disastrous of 99% of all citizens only the 1% will benefit from these technologies. I would say Technological advancements but I more likely call them technological setbacks. I say this because none of these technology truly help support humanity, the planet or biological life. We have put too much power in the hands of few who plan to remove agriculture, biology with artificial food, intelligence and humanism with Robo-humanoids. The fact that we are looking towards robots and artificial thinking to save us is troubling in on itself (by its very nature).   \n",

God like a judge in court can’t let the guilty go unpunished but if someone pays your fine you can leave innocent that’s What God did He became a human and lived the sinless perfect life and then died for your and my sins our moral crimes against God. God took the punishment we owe and then 3 days Later He rose from The dead ( I encourage you to look at the evidence for The resurrection of Jesus Christ and evidence for God’s existence ) I was suicidal and felt like There wouldn’t be a real reason to not commit suicide Then I saw a youtube video pop up on my phone about Jesus and the gospel message and it said if I accept Jesus Chirst as my Lord and Savior from my sins and ask Him to Fill me With His Holy Spirit I would be saved and God would change my life from the inside out and I said a prayer for Jesus to come and change my life and I told Him “I will do whatever you want me to just take this anxiety from me!” and in a second I saw a Light It was The Holy Spirit He entered me and I could only describe the feeling like “ I feel alive for the first time in my life” and “I felt litterly what Truth feels like” and ever since I have seen God do miralces through me like healing people litterly instant healing or people’s body’s and also cast out demons I’m am 19 and God saved my life and If you accept Christ as your Lord and Savior Ask To be filled With His Holy Spirit and To forgive your sins by believing He rose from The dead you will go to heaven and God will put heaven into you That’s what The bible says you can do this now God loves you Enough to become human and die for you.</td>\n",

You mention nothing about him and Trump.  You mention nothing about Kim Jong Nam who was murdered in Malaysia.  You mention nothing about Kim Woo Choong who funded Trumps Tower, then making a Trump move by filing Bankruptcy of Billions of dollars, crashing the S. Korean Economy, then disappearing, first to N.Korea to.give the money to Kim Jong Nam to money launder into Russia, then to Malaysia.  His mother lived in Russia. What you think he never met jho lo? A pal of Trump to murder Kim Jong Nam. To blame on Kim Jong Un. Yeah Trump got his money, when  Kim Jong Nam gave Kim Woo Choong money laundering account info to jho lo, before he was murdered with Nerve Agent VX.   \n",

A hero doesn't go public to gain or profit in anyway from his actions. A hero doesn't enjoy killing the 'bad guy.' A hero doesn't write a book telling people how he would love to kill more 'bad guys.'   \n",

              "2076  How does this happen? Why aren't returning soldiers etc. from war screened, or what ever its called, to find mental disorders or more as a result from trauma in war. This guy should of never been allowed in public as well as having access to Chris Kyle etc. Or since Chris was a decorated and valuable vet, why wasn't he protected or at the very least, advised of the possible dangers of contact with a person in a mental state as Eddie Routh was. I know soldiers returning are interviewed for possible problems resulting from war etc. Not sure, but something is missing, or missed, and Chris and his friend Chad, are victims of it. Now the question is, was anything learned here? Like more affective screening of returning or more of personnel? Don't know. Did we learn anything about security from the 9-11-01 WTC attacks? I doubt it.   \n",

Doing any activity with PTSD veterans that involves firearms is a huge mistake. There's so many other things they could do that would be healthier, more productive, and with less risk of violence. Putting them behind a trigger just brings their former violent behavior to the forefront. It's only natural that they'll want to kill again, particularly if they are suffering from extreme psychological problems.   \n",

Up to 10% of women and 5% of men will experience it. Usually it involves being haunted by distressing memories and thoughts, having full blown flashbacks where individuals loose connection to reality is more rare. The only way this makes sense to me is If the guy had one of these flashbacks and shot Kyle and the other guy because he mentally was back in a combat situation and they were his enemies.   \n",

It must be hard, because we human beings are so fickle. I take the Word of God as my bread and butter and the world turns against me all the time, but God delivers me each and every single last time.\\n\\nGod is trustworthy. Human beings are not, never have been, never can be.\\n\\nI'm a human being. I know. I tell lies to myself all the time. I tell myself I'm going to get up when my alarm clock goes off. When my alarm clock goes off, everything that can go wrong in the day hits me at the same time, and I don't get out of bed.\\n\\nI didn't even intend to lie against myself. I just got knocked out by my own thoughts. I need God to turn this war within my very heart and soul and mind and strength around so that I can actually love my neighbours as myself. So far, I've been a failure on both fronts. But I feel the tide of battle turning, slowly, but surely.\\n\\nSatan, watch out! You can pin me down, but someone else will get you. We outnumber you many to one.\\n\\nWhile you pin me down, I can pray for others, so that they can rise up against you. What are you going to do about that? Kill me?\\n\\nEven if you succeed in killing me, plenty more will jump in my place. Then, what are you going to do? We are the very humanity you scammed out of our God given birthright in Adam's generation.\\n\\nAnd we're here to take back what is rightfully ours. Jesus has paid the full price for our sins. Now, He's leading us onwards to consolidate His Finished Victory over you!   \n",

I think they should let it go. They both was wrong. Will Smith has been punished enough. Chris Rock, being a comedian has the right to say what ever he wants, but not everyone thinks he's funny. This was a learning experience for  everyone involved or not. My opinion, it doesn't matter the time or place, people should really think about the things they want to say before they say it, everyone has feelings and this is what happens after you make a joke about a person's condition. It could have been worse. Chris Rock should be thankful for that being the only thing that happened to him. Some say they would have hit him more than once. Let this go. How much more does Will have to pay for something anyone else would have done. Enough is Enough.   \n",

I’m 17 and I know that in everything you do there has to be a balance.. you want to play football you have to balance it with health practices you want to play games you have to balance it out with healthy down time with friends and family.. you want to smoke weed you have to balance it out with not smoking everyday making sure you start a health smoke cycle…   \n",

He's got the public on his side BIG TIME.  She stays in his ear and if he doesn't stop listening to her, we're going to lose him. I'd love to see him win and he can do it, big time. He is big time and it's because of his morals and respect. I'd kick that nasty mfer TO THE CURB.  Dang if he can't do better.   \n",
              "15  Isaiah 53:5, he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed.  For salvation, we just need to follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in water for the removal of sins and filled with the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38!  Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead and walking in the newness of life. That's what Acts 2:38 is.  We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD.  We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed.  One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.  Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.  It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction.  Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.  Don't get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS and the other is a WORK OF FAITH.  Titus 1:16, They profess that they know God; but in WORKS they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. God bless you   \n",

It was fake !! HEAR ME OUT. IT WAS All a fake act to program us to a black man handling the situation toxically. Every Since Janet Jackson flashed the whole world with her breast on live TV. It’s required that live television has some type of timed delay so things like this wouldn’t be shown if it unexpectedly happened. if that was real, it could’ve been taken out and edited to where they would’ve skipped it without us even knowing. If it was real they could have even played an Emergency commercial just to cover it up. BUT THEY DIDNT. And they didn’t even try to cover it up😂 lol that lets us know it was all fake I.M.O. THEY ARE ACTORS, EVERYWHERE!EVEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT ON SET of FOR FILMING A MOVIE. Lol an actor is an actor, sometimes every where. Will is trying to remain relevant to Jada, in Hollywood, and to the world. Who can disagree with all these facts??? I’ll wait… I’d say u crazy if u think this is still real after reading   \n",

This whole episode is about Will/Jada fight against racism, the 2016 boycott..and CR being a Tom by clowning them for it. There’s nothing new here. Throughout history Racists have always hated Racist fighters, and they’ll back the side of an UT. The black ppl who are backing CR are either naive about history or some are actively loving being in this sunken place where they can continue to receive those crumbs from Masta.

He will be lucky if he makes another film. He should be jailed. It is like he should have had a time out on the naughty step. Lost respect  for him. What a prick and Chris should have filed charges against him, no matter who he is. Dickheads like that get away with everything cos they have money.

My opinion, it doesn't matter the time or place, people should really think about the things they want to say before they say it, everyone has feelings and this is what happens after you make a joke about a person's condition.

They were baptized in water for the removal of sins and filled with the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38!  Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead and walking in the newness of life. That's what Acts 2:38 is.  We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD.  We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed.  One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.  Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.  It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction.  Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.  Don't get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS and the other is a WORK OF FAITH.  Titus 1:16, They profess that they know God; but in WORKS they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
